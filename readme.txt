Safe.Shop allows you to shop online with confidence around the world. We certify online shops according to the Global Code of Conduct which means that you know exactly what your rights are when you see the Safe.Shop trustmark.

* Increase Conversion & Order Size : Safe.Shop's trustmark and Consumer Review System helps you increase consumer trust and, as a result, increases both your conversion ratio as well as order size.
